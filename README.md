# Machine Learning Charity Project: Donor Engagement Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Machine Learning Project. The project focuses on developing a predictive model to optimize donor engagement for a nonprofit organization. By analyzing donor behavior and predicting their likelihood of future donations, the project aims to recommend personalized outreach strategies to maximize contributions and support the nonprofit's mission.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into donor behavior.
- Feature engineering to create relevant predictors for the machine learning model.
- Implementation of a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model to predict donor engagement.
- Creation of an interactive dashboard using [Dashboarding Tool] for visualization.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
